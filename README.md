# cs-resend-email
Created with CodeSandbox

This is a simplistic/minimalistic form that can be used by CS agents to resend emails. When the form is successfully completed, it will send an XHR request to Trigger Service to resend an email if there is a match (the most recent occurrence of a match). On completion, TS responds with a confirmatory message and the form is reset for next use.
